### Cookie law compliance
It is up to the user to correctly implement this integration in compliance with the EU privacy law. However, we provide a simple opt-out page for end users.

This will not disable the system. It will simply inhibit tracking, and thus the quality of the recommendations delivered to the user.

Usersâ€™ IP addresses are anonimzed before storage. All behavioural information is stored in anonimized form. All personal information is stored on a separate database. These two features are designed to make us unable to match the information across the two databases.
